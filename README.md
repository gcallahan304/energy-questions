## Using GPG Keys with GitHub CLI for Enhanced Security and Privacy

This project utilizes GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys for authentication with GitHub through the GitHub CLI. Here's why this approach is valuable:

### Security Benefits:
1. **Identity Verification**: GPG keys provide cryptographic proof of your identity, ensuring that commits and operations are genuinely from you.
2. **Tampering Prevention**: Signed commits cannot be altered without detection, maintaining the integrity of your codebase.
3. **Access Control**: GPG keys can be easily revoked if compromised, providing better control over repository access.

### Privacy Advantages:
1. **Email Protection**: Your email address can be kept private while still verifying your identity.
2. **Pseudonymous Contributions**: You can contribute under a pseudonym while still cryptographically verifying your identity.

### Workflow Improvements:
1. **CLI Integration**: GitHub CLI with GPG key authentication allows for secure, command-line based workflows.
2. **Automated Signing**: Once set up, all your commits and tags can be automatically signed.
3. **Simplified Key Management**: GitHub CLI simplifies the process of adding and managing GPG keys on your GitHub account.
